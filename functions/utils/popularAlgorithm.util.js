/**
 * Scores non-personalized home rail items.
 *
 * Simple version for Popular:
 * - An asset can show only after rankAndDedupe passes the hard filters:
 *   it has an id, belongs to someone else, is not deleted, is Available, and is
 *   not suppressed from recommendations.
 * - Then we add three numbers. Bigger total wins.
 *    - **popularityScore**: a stored marketplace signal for general demand or
 *   performance. Higher means the asset is doing better overall.
 *    - **qualityScore**: a quality signal from reviews/ratings. For this generic
 *   score, unrated assets still get 2.5 so they are not buried immediately.
 *    - **recommendationScore**: a stored marketplace signal for generic
 *   recommendation strength.
 *    - **categoryBoost**: a fixed +8 bonus when the asset category matches a provided
 *   category hint.
 *
 * Popular ranking favors marketplace popularity, quality, and light freshness:
 *   popularityScore + qualityScore + freshnessBoost
 *
 * Generic recommendation ranking, retained for non-personalized/feed reuse,
 * favors marketplace recommendation score, quality, matching category hints,
 * and light freshness:
 *   recommendationScore + qualityScore + categoryBoost + freshnessBoost
 *
 * Quality falls back to 2.5 for unrated assets so new unrated listings can
 * still appear instead of being completely buried.
 *
 * Freshness is a small bonus. A newer asset gets more of it; an older asset
 * slowly loses it. This helps fresh listings appear without letting age beat
 * strong popularity or quality.
